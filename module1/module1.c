1. what is software? what is software engineering?
    ->software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate a computer and execute specific tasks.
    ->software engineering is the branch of compluter science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.

2.explain types of software
    ->System software. These software programs are designed to run a computer's application programs and hardware. System software coordinates the activities and functions of the hardware and software.
    ->Driver software. Also known as device drivers, this software is often considered a type of system software. Device drivers control the devices and peripherals connected to a computer, enabling them to perform their specific tasks. Every device that is connected to a computer needs at least one device driver to function.
    ->Middleware. The term middleware describes software that mediates between application and system software or between two different kinds of application software.
    ->Programming software. Computer programmers use programming software to write code. Programming software and programming tools enable developers to develop, write, test and debug other software programs.

3. What is SDLC?explain each phase of SDLC
    Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
    ->A software life cycle model (also termed process model) is a pictorial and diagrammatic representation of the software life cycle. A life cycle model represents all the methods required to make a software product transit through its life cycle stages. It also captures the structure in which these methods are to be undertaken.
    SDLC Cycle
    SDLC Cycle represents the process of developing software. SDLC framework includes the following steps:
    
    Stage1: Planning and requirement analysis
    ->Requirement Analysis is the most important and necessary stage in SDLC.
    ->The senior members of the team perform it with inputs from all the stakeholders and domain experts or SMEs in the industry.
    ->Planning for the quality assurance requirements and identifications of the risks associated with the projects is also done at this stage.
    Business analyst and Project organizer set up a meeting with the client to gather all the data like what the customer wants to build, who will be the end user, what is the objective of the product. Before creating a product, a core understanding or knowledge of the product is very necessary.

    Stage2: Defining Requirements
    ->Once the requirement analysis is done, the next stage is to certainly represent and document the software requirements and get them accepted from the project stakeholders.
    ->This is accomplished through "SRS"- Software Requirement Specification document which contains all the product requirements to be constructed and developed during the project life cycle.

    Stage3: Designing the Software
    ->The next phase is about to bring down all the knowledge of requirements, analysis, and design of the software project. This phase is the product of the last two, like inputs from the customer and requirement gathering.

    Stage4: Developing the project
    ->In this phase of SDLC, the actual development begins, and the programming is built. The implementation of design begins concerning writing code. Developers have to follow the coding guidelines described by their management and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to develop and implement the code.

    Stage5: Testing
    ->After the code is generated, it is tested against the requirements to make sure that the products are solving the needs addressed and gathered during the requirements stage.
    ->During this stage, unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing are done.

    Stage6: Deployment
    ->Once the software is certified, and no bugs or errors are stated, then it is deployed.
    ->Then based on the assessment, the software may be released as it is or with suggested enhancement in the object segment.
    ->After the software is deployed, then its maintenance begins.

    Stage7: Maintenance
    ->Once when the client starts using the developed systems, then the real issues come up and requirements to be solved from time to time.
    ->This procedure where the care is taken for the developed product is known as maintenance.
